# ML-Algorithms-to-Classfy-of-Wine-Quality-Data
1. Classifying wine quality categories (Good or Bad) using various supervised learning techniques. - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest &amp; Support Vector Machine.
2. The performance of each model will be meticulously evaluated through metrics such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Predictive values.
3. By a thorough comparison of outcomes, the project intends to identify the optimal model based on evaluation metrics.
